## Hi there, I'm Evan Kennedy! 👋

I'm a full-stack developer based in Winnipeg, Canada, passionate about building web applications and solving complex problems. I enjoy both frontend and backend development and am always seeking opportunities to broaden my knowledge. When I'm not coding, I like to read, blog, or play sports.

I graduated with a Diploma in Software Development from the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology.
