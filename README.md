## Hi there, I'm Evan Kennedy! üëã

I'm a software developer based in Winnipeg, Canada, with a passion for web 
development. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm always eager to 
learn and explore new technologies. I love creating interactive and user-friendly 
web applications that make a positive impact on people's lives.

I enjoy working on both frontend and backend development, and I'm constantly 
seeking opportunities to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge in software 
development. When I'm not coding, you can find me reading, blogging, or playing 
sports.
